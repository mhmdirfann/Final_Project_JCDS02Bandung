## About Zomato Dataset
Zomato is a restaurant search site that provides information for eating out, take-out messages, cafes and nightlife for cities in Indonesia, India, Turkey, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and English. According to the Alexa website, this site ranked 1,926 in the world and 205 in India in October 2013.Dataset was taken from Kaggle (reference:https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data).

The collected data has been stored in the Comma Separated Value file Zomato.csv. Each restaurant in the dataset is uniquely identified by its Restaurant Id. Every Restaurant contains the following variables:

- Restaurant Id: Unique id of every restaurant across various cities of the world
- Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant
- Country Code: Country in which restaurant is located
- City: City in which restaurant is located
- Address: Address of the restaurant
- Locality: Location in the city
- Locality Verbose: Detailed description of the locality
- Longitude: Longitude coordinate of the restaurant's location
- Latitude: Latitude coordinate of the restaurant's location
- Cuisines: Cuisines offered by the restaurant
- Average Cost for two: Cost for two people in different currencies
- Currency: Currency of the country
- Has Table booking: yes/no
- Has Online delivery: yes/ no
- Is delivering: yes/ no
- Switch to order menu: yes/no
- Price range: range of price of food
- Aggregate Rating: Average rating out of 5
- Rating color: depending upon the average rating color
- Rating text: text on the basis of rating of rating
- Votes: Number of ratings casted by people

# Data Pre-Processing
- Fill NaN values (using modes and mean)
- Drop unnecessary values and column
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Convert all currencies to USD for analysis average cost data for two column
- Create column for location and total cuisine variety
# Machine Learning Modelling
#### Predicting Average cost for two (USD)
Data price prediction is processed using regression with the model taken using Gradient Boosting Regressor.
In the initial step, the data has been tested with several models such as:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor
- GradientBoostingRegressor
- Ridge

##### And the best model is GradientBoostingRegressor  because it has the smallest RMSE:1.468 and the biggest R2 score:82%
##### After i choose GradientBoostingRegressor model as the modelling for prediction average cost for two (USD), i searched the best parameter from GradientBoostingRegressor with Hyperparamater tuning with GridSearchCV.
##### Here my code i used to find best parameters with GridSearchCV:

##### And here the result of best parameters:

#### Recommendation System
At the first step, data recommendation is processed using Count Vectorizer to make the list of cuisines countable to find the cosine similarity with another restaurants. The second step is create new columns for more powerful insight for user such as Location (Locality Verbose column + City) and Approximate Distance (Km) to define distance between the main restaurant and the alternative restaurants by using Haversine formula. The final step is combining cosine similarity between location and cuisines so the recommendations are more relevant for user.
